		<h1>History of Taldykorgan city</h1>
		<p>Taldykorgan, the administrative capital of Almaty Region, is a city on the rise. Individuals representing nearly 70 different nationalities and ethnicities live in peace and harmony and its rich history and bright future make it an interesting location for residents and visitors.Originally a hamlet inhabited by Russian and Ukrainian immigrants, Taldykorgan was officially established in 1868 as Gavrilovka. Its history, however, dates to the ninth century as evidenced by the remnants of settlements and burial grounds. Taldykorgan is Kazakh for “a willow hill” and their presence blocks extreme winds, alleviating its sharply continental climate and making the city a pleasant place to live. In addition to their practical function, the trees also have an aesthetic role, as the first thing tourists notice is the prevalence of green.
